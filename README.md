# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" in C#.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply compile and run the Program.cs file using any C# compiler.

## Prerequisites

    A C# compiler (such as Visual Studio, .NET SDK, or Mono)
    .NET Framework (if using Windows)

## How to Play

The game prompts the user to choose between "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" by entering either "R", "P", or "S". The computer will also randomly choose one of the three options.

After the user makes a choice, the game will display the computer's choice, determine the winner, and keep score of the number of wins for both the user and the computer.

The game will then ask the user if they want to play again. If the user selects "yes", the game will start over. If the user selects "no", the game will end, and the final score will be displayed.
